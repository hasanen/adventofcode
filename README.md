# Advent of code

## 2021

Last year I used rust and learned enought that I was able to start https://github.com/hasanen/my-hours. With same mentality (no cleanups etc), I was thinking to try out [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) this year.

## 2020

My goal is to learn and use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to solve the problems. Once I get the answer, I move on. I won't clean the code, so it will be ugly. Along the way I will try to structure the code better.
